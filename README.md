**MasterMind**

Side project to practice C# fundamentals.

---

## Background

I met with Craig on 1/15 to discuss doing a side project. I love board games and he mentioned MasterMind when we started talking about my ideas. I hadn't heard of it, but I quickly discovered some terribly-wonderful gems like this one: [MasterMind Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZr_fC2_MSE). I could also see how this could start and grow as I learn more.

## Criteria

1. Create a C# console application that is a simple version of Mastermind. 
2. The randomly generated answer should be four (4) digits in length, with each digit ranging from 1 to 6.
3. After the player enters a combination, a minus (-) sign should be printed for every digit that is correct but in the wrong position, and a plus (+) sign should be printed for every digit that is both correct and in the correct position. 
4. Print all plus signs first, all minus signs second, and nothing for incorrect digits. 
5. The player has ten (10) attempts to guess the number correctly before receiving a message that they have lost.
